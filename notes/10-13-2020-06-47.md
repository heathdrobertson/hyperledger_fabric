What Is a Network Artifact? 

> The initial configuration-related files that we generate at the start of a network. Typical network artifacts include channel configuration .tx files (e.g., ChannelName.tx), the Genesis block, and the anchor peer transactions. These files are generated and they can then be referenced later to be implemented in the network.
